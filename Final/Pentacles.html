        <h2> Suit of Pentacles</h2>
        <p> The pentacles is the suit of all things worldly and material. Though we will immediately think of the pentacles as relating
          to financial matters, we also can understand them as being associated with security, stability, nature, health, and prosperity.
          The pentacles are of earth element. When we see pentacles show up in a reading, they are usually concerned with your long term future,
          career, generosity, your household, business investments and your feelings of sensuality. The negative side of the pentacles show up
          as greed, jealousy, miserliness, and unbridled ambition at the cost of all else.</p>
