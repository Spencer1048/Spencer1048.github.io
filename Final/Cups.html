          talk about relationships, whether romantic or otherwise, and one's imagination and inner world. They are associated with the
          element of water, which becomes a frequent visual theme within this suit. At their worst, the cups suit is fret with uncontrolled
          feelings, fantasy, and a disconnect with one's inner voice.</p>
