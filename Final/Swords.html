            <h2>The King Of Swords</h2>
            <p>With a sharp intellect and clarity of mind, the King of Swords is a representative of the truth and its authority.
               He cuts through deception and is able to rule with a stern and calm intellect. He serves as an incorruptible pillar of strength
               through his calm of mind.</p>

            <h2>The Knight Of Swords</h2>
            <p>The power of an idea to overwhelm is represented by the Knight of Swords. Filled with the vision of an idea, he is propelled forward
               with unbridled ambition. THough his energy is great, there is also a warning associated with being unconscious about
               consequences and obstacles.</p>

            <h2>IX Of Swords</h2>
            <p>The nine of swords represents someone that is trapped by their own negative thoughts. There is not necessarily
               a situation that warrants the worry, and this card hints that over-analysis leads to crippling indecision
               and feelings of helplessness.</p>

          <h2>Suit of Swords</h2>
          <p>The swords is the suit of intelligence, logic, truth, ambition, conflict and communication. It is associated
             with the element of air. In readings, these cards focus on the faculty and power of intellect, which like the swords
             themselves, are double-edged. This can be used for both good or evil, to help and to harm, and our greatest conflicts
             usually come from this delicate balance. At their worst, the swords can be abusive, harsh, and lack empathy.</p>
